                <p>Airbnb has soared in popularity over the past decade and most travelers need no introduction to the accomodation platform that revolutionized the way a lot of people travel. It certainly did that for me. I’ve been on the road since 2008, and over the past few years I have relied on Airbnb to find cute or boutique properties that offer a more local experience than a more sanitized hotel experience—many Airbnb listings are located within a city’s local neighborhoods. I rented an adorable, Pinterest-perfect apartment in Tbilisi, Georgia one year and a gorgeous flat in Paris for a whirlwind week in the City of Love just this past summer. I loved both experiences and happily parked my backpack at these local spots while I explored. But not all of my experiences were so ideal, and it’s always been at the back of my mind: What should you do when you’re having a bad Airbnb experience?</p>

                <p>Once you arrive and check in, understand that you have 24 hours to file a formal complaint through Airbnb, complete with any proof that you have verifying your claim (photos or audio/video recordings). If you’re outside of that window, the company only addresses the most egregious issues and minor Airbnb disputes become fairly unfixable. All of the potential travel issues mentioned above do qualify for a refund if you follow the right steps—since the company offers 24/7 customer service, file the complaint as soon as you know there is no other resolution possible.</p>

                <p>Not all Airbnbs operate the same way, and you should first assess the nature of your Airbnb and the type of issue before deciding on a course of action. Some Airbnbs are run by property management companies, others are actually small hotels/guesthouses (increasingly the case in developing countries), and some are homes/apartments owned by a local who use the space as a primary or secondary residence. Some hosts may be very responsive to feedback, but this is particularly true for Airbnbs run like a business. If you’re facing an issue that compromises your safety or health, leave immediately—this includes if you’re in open conflict with the host.</p>

                <p>Airbnb refund policies favor the host in many ways, and the company requires guests to first address issues directly with their host before the company will step into the situation. The exact wording notes that to qualify for a refund, guests must “have used reasonable efforts to remedy the circumstances of the Travel Issue”. If your safety is not compromised, but instead the rental situation is not meeting your expectations, talk about the situation during the key exchange phase, before your host leaves the property. If that’s not possible, message your host through the Airbnb app—this acts as a record of your dispute should you need to escalate the situation. For professionally run properties, the host may immediately act to fix the situation. In my own experiences, my hosts have always been quick and keen to address minor issues, like the time the inflatable mattress had a hole, or when I was miffed that the kitchen was devoid of all cooking and eating utensils. But if you’re talking major issues, then it’s important that you send a message that clearly communicates your expectations and how the property is not meeting them.</p>
